## Storyboard (Round 2)

<center>Experiment: Compressibility Chart</center>

**1. Story Outline**:

The compressibility factor (Z) is a correction factor. The magnitude of Z for a certain gas at a particular pressure and temperature gives an indication of deviation of the gas from ideal gas behaviour.

For a particular gas, the compressibility factor Z is a function of p (pressure) and T (temperature). The compressibility chart is made up of lines of constant temperature on coordinates of p and Z. Using this plot, Z can be determined for any value of p and T. A compressibility factor chart exists for each substance.

In this experiment, we use the Nelson-Obert generalized compressibility chart, in order to demonstrate how to read a generalized compressibility chart as well as how to use it to find unknown quantities like volume.

In order to use a compressibility chart, two of the three reduced properties (reduced pressure, reduced temperature, reduced volume) must be known. Then, the third unknown quantity can be obtained. In a compressibility chart, reduced pressure P<sub>r</sub> and compressibility factor Z are on the x-axis and y-axis respectively. When given the reduced pressure and temperature, Z can be determined using the chart.  If any two values out of pressure, temperature and volume of the substance are known, then the third quantity can be found out using the compressibility chart.

 **2. Story**:

  **2.1 Set the visual stage description**:

  The experiment consists of the Nelson-Obert generalized compressibility chart, shown in the main window. All the buttons and the parameters control are on the right side of the frame. The variable panel contains information about the gas used as well as values of five variables (P, T, v, P<sub>cr</sub>, T<sub>cr</sub>), one of which is to be found out using the graph.

  The controls panel consists of four radio buttons, representing four different examples. On clicking any of the radio buttons, the corresponding graph is shown and indicated lines are drawn on it, according to which quantity is unknown.

  **2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals**:
